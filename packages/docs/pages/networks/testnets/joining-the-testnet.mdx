# Joining the latest testnet

Depending on whether you are a genesis validator, you can join the latest testnet either as a genesis validator or as a full node.

## Joining as a genesis validator

In order to join the network as a genesis validator, you will need to have been selected in the genesis ceremony. If you have not been selected, you can still join as a full node.
If you have been selected. You must run the following command:

```bash
CHAIN_ID="<chain-id>"
VALIDATOR_ALIAS="<your-validator-alias>"
namadac utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --genesis-validator $VALIDATOR_ALIAS
```

<Callout>
Note that if you use the above command, your pre-genesis wallet must be in the default base directory (`$BASE_DIR`). If the wallet is not in the default base directory, you must use the flag `--pre-genesis-path` instead. The value for this will be `$BASE_DIR/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS`.

E.g if your base directory is `.namada` and your validator alias is `my-validator`, then run the command 

```bash
CHAIN_ID="<chain-id>"
VALIDATOR_ALIAS="my-validator"
BASE_DIR=".namada"
namadac utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --pre-genesis-path $BASE_DIR/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS
```
</Callout>

Running the node of a pre-genesis validator is identical to that of a mainnet validator.

For this reason, please refer to [these docs](../../operators/validators/validator-setup.mdx#start-validating) for running the node.

## Joining as a full node
If you are not a genesis validator, please follow the steps for [joining as a full node](../../operators/ledger/running-a-full-node.mdx). 

It is then possible to test being a validator by [becoming a post-genesis validator](./post-genesis-validator.mdx).
