# Base ledger

The base ledger of Namada includes a [consensus mechanism](./base-ledger/consensus.mdx) and a validity-predicate based [execution system](./base-ledger/execution.mdx). 

## Consensus
The consensus mechanism on Namada provides an algorithmic way for validators to communicate votes and collectively agree on a consistent state. The algorithm, coupled with a cryptoeconomic voting power allocation mechanism called "proof of stake", is designed so that that non-colluding validators acting in their (economic) self interest will follow the consensus algorithm in a predictable manner.

## Validity predicates (Resource Logics)
The validity-predicate (now known as resource logic) based execution mechanism is inherited from the architectural design philosophy of Anoma. The fundamental idea is that a "valid state" is defined as that which satisfies a set of boolean conditions. These boolean conditions are encoded by functional ([in the programtic sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)) "validity predicates", which are invoked whenever a state is being proposed. If all validity predicates in the system return the boolean `true`, this defines a valid state which validators can vote on. The validity predicate based mechanism differs from the traditional "smart-contract" based execution model, where a valid state is instead defined as that which results from a series of pre-defined valid execution steps. These execution steps are defined within the smart contract, and verifying the validity of the new state requires *each* validator to run the series of execution steps.

## Replay protection & block space allocator
In addition to describing the execution model and consensus, this section  also documents Namada's [replay protection system](./base-ledger/replay-protection.mdx), and [block space allocator](./base-ledger/block-space-allocator.mdx).
