# Base ledger

The base ledger of Namada includes a [consensus mechanism](./base-ledger/consensus.mdx) and a validity-predicate based [execution system](./base-ledger/execution.mdx). 

## Consensus

The consensus mechanism on Namada provides an algorithmic way for validators to communicate votes and collectively agree on a single, consistent state in a Byzantine-fault-tolerant manner. The algorithm, coupled with a cryptoeconomic voting power allocation mechanism called "proof of stake", is designed so that that non-colluding validators acting in their (economic) self interest will follow the consensus algorithm in a predictable manner.

## Validity predicates

The validity predicate based execution mechanism is inherited from the architectural design philosophy of Anoma. The fundamental idea is that a "valid state" is defined as that which satisfies a set of boolean conditions. These boolean conditions are encoded by "validity predicates", represented as WASM or Rust-native functions, which are invoked whenever a state is being proposed. If all validity predicates in the system return the boolean `true`, this defines a valid state which validators can vote on. The validity predicate based mechanism differs from the traditional "smart-contract" based execution model, where a valid state is instead defined as that which results from a series of pre-defined valid execution steps.

## Replay protection & block space allocator
In addition to describing the execution model and consensus, this section  also documents Namada's [replay protection system](./base-ledger/replay-protection.mdx), which prevents transactions from being executed multiple times, and [block space allocator](./base-ledger/block-space-allocator.mdx), which packs transactions into blocks.
