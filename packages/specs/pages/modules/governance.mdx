# Governance

Namada introduces a governance mechanism to propose and apply protocol changes without the need for a hard fork, and to signal stakeholder approval for potential hard forks. 
Any user able to deposit the correct amount of `NAM` is able to propose some changes in a proposal for which delegators and validators cast their `yay` or `nay` votes. 
It is also possible to attach some payloads to proposals, in specific cases, to embed additional information.

Governance on Namada supports both `signaling` and `voting` mechanisms. 
The signaling mechanism is used for changes which require a hard fork, while the voting mechanism is used for changes which merely alter state. 
In cases where the chain is not able to produce blocks anymore, Namada relies on [off-chain signaling](#off-chain-protocol) to agree on a common move.

Further information about delegators, validators, and NAM can be found in the [proof-of-stake section](./proof-of-stake.mdx).

Namada supports both on chain and on chain governance.
The on-chain governance process exists to assist in reaching social consensus in a structured, well-defined way. 
Social consensus may also be reached off-chain through any community-selected mechanism.
It is expected that the community will use the offline proposal mechanism primarily for when the chain is halted.

## Definitions

Before describing Namada governance, it is useful to define the concepts of NAM, validators, delegators, and delegates.

*Cryptoeconomic terminology*

> Namada's economic model is based around a single native token, **NAM**, which is controlled by the protocol.

*Consensus terminology*

> A Namada **validator** is an account with a public consensus key, which may participate in producing blocks and governance activities. A validator may not also be a **delegator** (although, of course, a user can control both validator and delegator keys).

#### Delegation in terms of ***consensus***:

Non-validator addresses on Namada are able to bond their tokens. When doing so, they specify a validator which is now responsible for voting on blocks on the bonder's behalf.
The validator's voting-power is proportional to the sum of its self-bonded tokens and all the bonded tokens from other addresses to their own address.

#### Delegation in terms of ***governance***:

With the above definitions in mind, we define the following terms:

> A Namada ***delegator*** is an account that delegates some tokens to a _delegate_ for governance voting purposes. 

Any address is either a delegator or a delegate, but not both.

> A Namada ***delegate*** is an account that has been given the right to vote on the behalf of a delegator. 

A delegate may not also be a delegator.

When an address bonds tokens, the address is able to specify a *delegate*. 
The respective validator of that address becomes the default *delegate* (explained below) of that address. 
Similarly, a delegate's `voting-power` (now in terms of voting on governance proposals, not blocks) is proportional to the sum of its self-bonded tokens and all the bonded tokens from other addresses to their own address.

> **Note**: Initially, Namada only supports validators as delegates. In the future, the ability for separate delegates may be added.
