# Multisignature

The "user" validity predicate is the default validity predicate for all user-owned accounts. It is a multisignature validity predicate that requires at least `k` out of `n` valid signatures to be present in the signed transaction data for every transaction originating from the user. By default, both `k` and `n` are set to 1, meaning that the user can sign transactions on their own. This is the default validity predicate for all user-owned accounts.
