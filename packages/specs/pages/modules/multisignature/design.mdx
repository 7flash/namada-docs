## Design Rationale

The k-of-n multisignature validity predicate authorizes transactions on the basis of k out of n parties approving them. This validity predicate targets the encrypted (inner) WASM transactions, which is what may be signed over multiple keys. Namada does not support multiple signers on wrapper, or protocol transactions. The signer of the wrapper transaction is the fee-payer of that transaction.

Namada transactions are signed before being delivered to the network. This signature is checked by the invoked validity predicates to determine the validity of the transaction. To support multisignature, Namada's signed transaction data includes the plaintext data of what is being signed, as well as all valid signatures over that data.

There are no special non-multisignature established accounts - all user accounts are just 1-of-1 multisignature accounts.
