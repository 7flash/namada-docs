## Storage keys

Once this transaction is executed, the following storage writes are made in association, under the storage subspace of that user:
- The `vp_user` address
{/* Find storage key */}
- The threshold of the multisignature account
- The list of public keys for the signers of the multisignature account

A rust storage implementation is shown below:
```rust
/$Address/threshold/: u8
/$Address/pubkeys/: LazyVec<PublicKey>
```
